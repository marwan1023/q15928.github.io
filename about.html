I am a <b>Google Cloud Certified Professional Data Engineer</b>. With rich experience in data analytics and engineering, I have successfully delivered various end-to-end solutions with both big data technologies and traditional databases which had been well recognised. I have worked on machine learning projects, such as anomaly detection, forecasting.
<br><br>
I have strong background of machine learning and data science. I have earned Master of Data Science from the University of Sydney. I have completed a Deep Learning Specialisation by Professor Andrew Ng in which I grasped deep learning foundations, frameworks, and architectures.
<br><br>
I am also fond of Traditional Chinese Medicine. I appreciate the theory of the rhythm of the human body following the natural changes and the inner "chi" being able to go through different paths which is the reason acupuncture takes effect. Hopefully one day I will like Paul (in <i>Kung Fu Panda</i>) to find the "inner peace".
